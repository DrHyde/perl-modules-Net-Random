This module gets truly random data from online sources.  Or at least,
they claim to be truly random.

Note that because we are testing random data, the tests of how well-
distributed the results are may occasionally fail.  If at first you
don't succeed try, try, try again.

The problem is explained here:

To install, do the usual:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

You may use, modify and distribute this code under the same terms as you
may use, modify and distribute perl itself.
