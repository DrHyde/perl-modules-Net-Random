This module gets truly random data from online sources.  Or at least,
they claim to be truly random.

Note that because we are testing random data, the tests of how well-
distributed the results are may occasionally fail.  If at first you
don't succeed try, try, try again.  If any individual tests
*consistently* fail, please let me know, but otherwise I'm only
interested in patches to the test suite.

Because we're testing against data sources out of our control, these may
sometimes refuse to give us any data.  In that case, the test suite will
spit warnings as well as fail the tests.  The remedy is to wait until later
and try again.

To install, do the usual:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

You may use, modify and distribute this code under the same terms as you
may use, modify and distribute perl itself.
